# bone_armor_redone

This mod has the purpose of re-instating bone armor which as of recently got removed, while also trying to balance it with the already existing armors in the game to make for a fair, yet reasonable trade-off. In order to not break any in world explanations as to why the armor is the way it is balanced, crafting recipes underwent a whole sleuth of changes, so don't expect them to be the same as you remember.


As of right now, this mod features 2 sets of armor:

The standard bone armor - revised:
Consist of: arm guards, gauntlets, boots, helmet, body armor
  -its learned at stages 4 and 5 of tailoring (3 fab prequisite to craft the parts required).

  -slightly different stats from leather armor (6/12 Bash/Cut instead of 8/8 Bash/Cut, whilst also less encumbring -10)

  -comes with 1 Acid, 1 env. protection

  -The bones required for the plates can be obtained by butchering skeletons and have to be processed into plating, this takes time.


Reinforced boneplated armor:

  -learned at stage 6/7 of tailoring

  -great overall protection  (15/25 Bash/Cut) for reasonable encumbrance (22), coming with 2 Acid, 3 Env. protection.

  -requires lots of filament for sewing on plates, costs the same amount of leather than the standard leather armor.

  -bone plating can be obtained by killing skeletal juggernauts.

  -crafting plating takes longer, as they are even sturdier and also require sophisticated drilling tools of any kind.
